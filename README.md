# BaltimoreParkingFacilities
Exploratory Data analysis 
I came across this dataset hosted on the Baltimore City government website. 
It basically has got the information about various parking facilities available in the city along with hours 
of operation and rates for parking charged by these operators for different time periods. To find the trends 
in the daily rate and the monthly rate and also have look at the number of operators present in the city. 
The data source location : https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Facilities/e29s-jddm 
The dataset has open access and is on CC 4.0 license as well. It has got 140 rows and 10 columns.
